I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python
challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time  every day coding 
along, foe a minimun of 10 min a day.
I'll bw using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do 
this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses
for mot coding from the middle of a field!

I am happy to join ReplitðŸ˜Ž""")
